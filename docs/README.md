Practical reference for admins, users, and developers working with the SteelRoot CMS. Each guide is self-contained:

- `user-guide.md` — day-to-day site management.
- `admin-guide.md` — system administration and maintenance.
- `developer-guide.md` — project structure, modules, and integration rules.
- `architecture.md` — how the system is organised and how data flows.
- `modules.md` — how to build and operate modules safely.
- `theming.md` — dark/light themes, tokens, and styling rules.
- `i18n.md` — localisation model and usage.
- `security.md` — protection, logging, and expected safeguards.

All content is technical and non-marketing. Keep HTML/PHP unchanged when applying these guidelines.***
