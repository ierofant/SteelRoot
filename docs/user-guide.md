# User Guide

Audience: editors and content managers working in the admin panel.

## Daily tasks
- Switch theme/locale in Settings → Theme/Locale to match your workflow.
- Keep navigation consistent via Settings → Menu and Homepage builder.
- Publish updates, then clear cache if something looks stale.

## Articles
- Create, edit, or unpublish articles in the Articles module.
- Use tags for grouping and better search.
- Respect module settings (show/hide author, date, likes, views, tags) set by admin.

## Gallery
- Upload images in Admin → Gallery Upload.
- Keep sizes reasonable; thumbnails are generated automatically.
- Lightbox and like counters depend on gallery settings configured by admin.

## Forms
- Build forms in Admin → Forms. Define fields, required flags, and order.
- Use provided embed/snippet locations; avoid duplicating fields across forms.
- Use blacklist/regex/domain rules to block obvious spam.

## Cache
- Clear cache after bulk edits (articles, gallery, theme, menu).
- Use cache clear instead of server restarts.

## Basic troubleshooting
- Check Security logs if users report access issues.
- Verify theme/locale matches expectations.
- If content does not appear, clear cache and recheck module settings.
- For media issues, ensure file type/size is allowed and regenerate thumbnails if needed.***
