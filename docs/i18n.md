# Internationalisation (i18n)

## Model
- Languages provided via per-module lang files: `modules/{Name}/lang/en.php` and `ru.php`.
- UI strings are retrieved with the `__()` helper; no hardcoded text in views.
- Admin and frontend share the same lang resolution logic.

## Structure
- Keys are flat strings grouped by prefix (e.g., `dashboard.title`, `modules.actions.enable`).
- Both `en` and `ru` files must contain the same keys.
- Do not rename keys without updating all references.

## Usage
- In views: `__('key')`.
- In controllers: pass already-localised strings only when unavoidable; prefer to keep localisation in views.
- Place new strings in the appropriate module’s lang files, not in core.

## Locale switching
- Global locale set in admin Settings.
- Locale applies to both frontend and admin.
- Ensure critical pages (auth, settings) have complete translations in both languages.

## Do/Don’t
- Do keep keys concise and descriptive.
- Do avoid concatenating translated fragments; use full phrases.
- Don’t mix languages in one locale file.
- Don’t fallback to hardcoded English in templates.***
